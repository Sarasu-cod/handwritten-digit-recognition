# Handwritten Digit Recogniton

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Trains on 60,000 handwritten digit images
- Predicts test data with high accuracy
- (Optional) Upload your own digit image to test the model

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## Files
- `Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook
- `my_digit.png` (optional): Sample test image

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in order.
